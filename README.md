# Introduction
*Have you ever dreamt of having a perfect sidekick?*

*Did you ever find your minecraft pets a bit ... underwhelming?*

If so, get ready for your next adventure, because you are about to meet ... **the companion bat**!

# How to obtain

To obtain a companion bat you will need to **feed a regular bat some pumpkin pie**.

# Characteristics

## Pocket bat

When tamed the companion bat will be added to your inventory as an item, this item can be used later to summon your new sidekick.

When summoned the bat will give the player a special flute to recall it back.

When in danger the companion bat will teleport automatically into the player's inventory, as long as its flute is still present.

## Leveling system

The companion bat initially starts weak but gets stronger by leveling up.

The bat can obtain experience by attacking mobs.

You can also train your Companion Bat by feeding it the rare **Pie o' Enchanting** whch can be found in treasure chests.

## Item pick up

You can give a bundle to the companion bat by placing it in the bundle slot (the third slot in the image right above here).

When given a bundle the bat can pick up items from the ground and store them in said bundle.

When the player is nearby the bat will automatically transfer its items to the owner's inventory.

## Bat equipments

There are currently 9 companion bats equipments and 6 accessories.

These equipments can be found in treasure chests across the various dimensions.

Each equipment grants a class that gives bat an unique set of abilities.

Accessories grant a single ability; most of these accessories possess an unique ability.

## Appearance

Each armor changes the bat appearance!
